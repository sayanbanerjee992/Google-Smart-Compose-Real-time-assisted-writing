# Google-Smart-Compose-Real-time-assisted-writing
The case study on Google Smart Compose: Real-time assisted writing is a Deep Learning-based Web application based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00080.pdf research paper. I have performed a LSTM based attention model to predict the next few words.  Lastly built a web application and deploy it to AWS using the AWS EC2 instance.
